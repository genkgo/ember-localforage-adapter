Ember Data Localforage Adapter
================================

Store your ember application data in [Mozilla's localForage](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage). Compatible with [Ember Data 1.0.0.beta.18](https://github.com/emberjs/data).

"localForage is a JavaScript library that improves the offline experience of your web app by using asynchronous storage (via IndexedDB or WebSQL where available) with a simple, localStorage-like API."

It is supported by all major browsers, including mobile.

Usage
-----

Install the addon using ember cli

```
ember install ember-localforage-adapter
```

Initialize the adapter.

```js
//app/adapters/application.js
import LFAdapter from 'ember-localforage-adapter/adapters/localforage';

export default LFAdapter;
```

For a more thorough introduction how to use this adapter, please read [Models and application data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Modern_web_app_architecture/Models_and_application_data) on the MDN website of Mozilla.

### Localforage Namespace

All of your application data lives on a single `localforage` key, it defaults to `DS.LFAdapter` but if you supply a `namespace` option it will store it there:

```js
//app/adapters/user.js
import LFAdapter from 'ember-localforage-adapter/adapters/localforage';

export default LFAdapter.extend({
  namespace: 'users'
});
```

### Cache

In order to reduce the number of getItem calls to localforage, you can specify a caching mechanism.

```js
import LFAdapter from 'ember-localforage-adapter/adapters/localforage';

export default LFAdapter.extend({
  caching: 'model|all|none'
});
```

While `all` will reduce the number of calls to getItem (for reading) to only one, you will fetch all your data in memory. The default
behaviour therefore is `model`. This means: if you query one model, it will fetch all the items of that model from localforage.

### Embedded records

Since version 0.7.0 this library is also compatible with Ember Data's embedded records. Include the embedded attributes in your
serializer like below and benefit from the often superior approach of doing complex object graphs when you don't really have full control over how and when data gets loaded. See the [specific PR](https://github.com/genkgo/ember-localforage-adapter/pull/24) for more information.

```js
// serializers/customer.js
export default LFSerializer.extend(
  DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin, {
    attrs: {
      addresses: { embedded: 'always' },
      hour: { embedded: 'always' }
    }
  }
);
```
